# Nosson-s-Text-Editor

This text editor is meant to be similar to the the VI Text editor

To navigate the text, use H,J,K and L.
Use "I" to enter insert mode and hit "esc" to exit.
"dd" deletes a line and "x" deletes a letter.
"u" is for undo

Full Discloser: 
This program is mostly functional, but there are some unresolved bugs...
